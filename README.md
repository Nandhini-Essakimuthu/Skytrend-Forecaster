Airline Passenger Analysis & Forecasting
This project focuses on analyzing airline passenger trends and forecasting future passenger counts using time series analysis. It utilizes historical passenger data to identify patterns, generate visual insights, and predict future trends with the SARIMA model.

Objective
Understand passenger trends over time.
Identify seasonal patterns and variations.
Forecast future passenger demand using statistical models.
Process Overview
1️⃣ Data Preparation & Cleaning
Reads the dataset and parses dates correctly.
Ensures the dataset is structured for time series analysis.
Aggregates passenger counts by time period (monthly/yearly).
2️⃣ Data Visualization & Insights
Trend Analysis: Line chart showing passenger growth over time.
Passenger Distribution: Bar chart displaying total passengers by airline.
Heatmap: Passenger density across different regions and years.
3️⃣ Time Series Forecasting (SARIMA Model)
Auto-ARIMA automatically determines the best SARIMA parameters.
Trains a SARIMA model to predict future passenger counts.
Evaluates model performance using error metrics:
MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – Measures the average absolute errors.
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – Quantifies the model’s accuracy.
MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) – Shows forecast precision as a percentage.
4️⃣ Forecasting Future Passenger Counts
Predicts the next 12 months of passenger traffic.
Generates a forecast visualization, highlighting expected trends.
Saves forecast results to a CSV file for further analysis.
Outcome
Identifies historical trends in passenger data.
Provides data-driven insights for airlines and stakeholders.
Helps in future planning and decision-making through reliable forecasts.
This project serves as a powerful tool for understanding past trends and making informed predictions about future airline passenger traffic.
